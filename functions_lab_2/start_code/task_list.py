# As a user, to manage my task list I would like a program that allows me to:

# 1. Print a list of uncompleted tasks
def uncomp_task(tasks_list):
    tasks_filtered = []
    for task in tasks_list:
        if task["completed"] == False:
            tasks_filtered.append(task["description"])
    return tasks_filtered
tasks_not_completed = uncomp_task(tasks)
#print(f"This tasks have not been completed: {tasks_not_completed}")

# 2. Print a list of completed tasks
def comp_task(tasks_list):
    tasks_filtered = []
    for task in tasks_list:
        if task["completed"] == True:
            tasks_filtered.append(task["description"])
    return tasks_filtered
tasks_completed = comp_task(tasks)
#print(f"The following tasks are the reason you can have your feet up: {tasks_completed}")

# 3. Print a list of all task descriptions
def all_tasks(tasks_list):
    tasks_filtered = []
    for task in tasks_list:
        if task["description"]:
            tasks_filtered.append(task["description"])
    return tasks_filtered
all_tasks_result = all_tasks(tasks)
#print(f"And here I present to you, all the tasks you had for today: {all_tasks_result}")

# 4. Print a list of tasks where time_taken is at least a given time
def time_it_takes(tasks_list):
    tasks_filtered = []
    for task in tasks_list:
        if task["time_taken"] > 10:
            tasks_filtered.append(task["description"])
    return tasks_filtered
timed_task = time_it_takes(tasks)
#print(f"The following tasks all take more than 10 minutes: {timed_task}")

# 5. Print any task with a given description
def task_descript(tasks_list, task_description):
    tasks_filtered = []
    for task in tasks_list:
        if task["description"] == task_description:
            tasks_filtered.append(task["description"])
    return tasks_filtered
tasks_result = task_descript(tasks, "Feed Cat")
#print(f"Hey, don't forget: {tasks_result}")

# 6. Given a description update that task to mark it as complete.
def task_now_completed(tasks_list, task_description):
    tasks_filtered = []
    for task in tasks_list:
        if task["completed"] == False:
            task["completed"] = True
            return tasks_filtered
tasks_now_result = task_now_completed(tasks, "feed the cat")
print(tasks_now_result)

# 7. Add a task to the list
tasks.append({"description": "Relax",
        "completed": False, 
        "time_taken": 1 
})
#print(tasks)
# ### Further Extensions

# 8. Use a while loop to display the following menu and allow the use to enter an option.

# ```python
# print("Menu:")
# print("1: Display All Tasks")
# print("2: Display Uncompleted Tasks")
# print("3: Display Completed Tasks")
# print("4: Mark Task as Complete")
# print("5: Get Tasks Which Take Longer Than a Given Time")
# print("6: Find Task by Description")
# print("7: Add a new Task to list")
# print("M or m: Display this menu")
# print("Q or q: Quit")
# ```

# 9. Call the appropriate function depending on the users choice.
